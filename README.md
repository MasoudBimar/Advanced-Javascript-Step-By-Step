## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone <repo-url>
```

2. Open the folder and explore lessons and exercises. Each lesson should include a markdown file and an optional `examples/` folder with runnable code.

## Repository Structure

Expected layout (may vary by lesson):

- README.md — this file
- course-template.md — lesson/course authoring template (use this for new lessons)
- lessons/ — lesson markdown files and assets
- examples/ — runnable examples and small projects
- solutions/ — exercise solutions (optional)

## How to Use the Material

- Read a lesson markdown in `lessons/` and follow the examples.
- Run example code in Node.js or a browser as appropriate.
- Try exercises before checking solutions. Solutions (if present) live in `solutions/` or in the lesson under a collapsed area.

Authoring new lessons

- Use `course-template.md` as a starting point for new lessons and ensure you include metadata, objectives, prerequisites, examples, exercises, and solutions where appropriate.

## Author / Contributor Notes

- Keep lessons concise (recommended: 800–2,000 words) with focused objectives.
- Provide at least one runnable example and one exercise per lesson.
- Prefer small files and clear naming: `lessons/<nn>-short-title.md` (zero-padded index recommended).
- Run tests or try the examples locally before submitting a PR.

## Course Template

Start new lessons from the `course-template.md` file in the repository root.
